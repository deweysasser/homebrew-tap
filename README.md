# Dewey's Homebrew Tap

A list of software I've written for which I maintain homebrew installs

## Software

  ```brew install deweysasser/tap/cumulus```


* [olympus](https://github.com/deweysasser/olympus) -- Terraform and GitOps

  ```brew install deweysasser/tap/olympus```


* [releasetool](https://github.com/deweysasser/releasetool) -- A tool for making homebrew (and eventually other) releases, like this one
